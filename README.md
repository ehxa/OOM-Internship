**Containerizing and Evaluating the WRF model for Cloud-Based HPC**

This work is part of the Master of Science Degree for Informatics Engineering with the aim of studying the WRF (Weather Research & Forecasting) model on multiple platforms and environments, while leveraging native, Docker, Slurm and Kubernetes technologies.
As such, we aim to ease the use of WRF with Docker images on HPC clusters and Cloud environments, while evaluating its performance.

You can find this work divided in 5 directories:
1. Docker: Docker files
2. Kubernetes: Deployments for using WRF with Kubernetes
3. Slurm: How to configure and use WRF using Slurm. 
4. logs: Test results using sample data from NCEP (National Centers for Environment Prediction (NCEP).
5. scripts: Scripts for General and CSP (Cloud Service Provider) specific (CNCA's (National Center for Advanced Computing) Stratus cloud platform) configuration and WRF execution.
